Clients are Node.js running on Intel Edison's connected via Bluetooth
to TI SensorTag and LightBlue Bean

I often just use two TI SensorTags instead of the LightBlue Bean.

My [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuWlr4oKSRUaPdRIoO9wGzpx4DqdpVYlV) includes several recordings of various IoT hardware+software demos. 

Note: My Intel Edison's and Raspberry Pis are pre-configured to look for
a specific SSID, a wifi router that travels with me (HooToo), they acquire an IP address via DNS and I use the router's console to see what IP addreses were assigned.
